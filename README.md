# To-Do List App

This is a simple To-Do List application built using JavaScript. It allows you to add, list, and delete to-do items interactively through prompts in the browser's console.

## Features

- Add new to-do items.
- List all to-do items.
- Delete specific to-do items by their index.
- Quit the app when finished.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Basic structure of the webpage.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality for managing the to-do list.

## How it Works

The app uses a simple JavaScript loop that continually prompts the user for input until the user chooses to quit. Here are the available actions:

1. **new**: Adds a new to-do item to the list.
2. **list**: Displays the list of all to-do items in the console.
3. **delete**: Prompts the user for an index to delete a to-do item from the list.
4. **quit**: Ends the app.

The user interacts with the app through the browserâ€™s prompt dialogs. The current list of to-dos is displayed in the console.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Todo-List-.git
   cd Todo-List-App
